  "description": "The purpose of this repo is to serve as an example for building a React application from scratch without abstracting away the required libraries and configurations, which occurs when building an application with create-react-app.  There is no one right way to build a React application from scratch. This is just an example cobbled together from other examples found on the Web. These instructions assume you are using the command line for everything, but you can create files however you like within an IDE like VSCode.",
